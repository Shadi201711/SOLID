# SOLID Principles: A Developer's Guide

SOLID is a set of design principles in object-oriented software development. It's an acronym that stands for the following five principles:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - A class should have only one reason to change. It should have a single responsibility.
   - Example: A `ProductManager` class should handle product management, but not payment processing.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Example: When adding a new payment method, we should extend existing code rather than modifying it.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
   - Example: If a `Bird` class has a `fly()` method, a `Penguin` subclass should also implement `fly()` (even if it does nothing).

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
   - Example: Instead of a monolithic `IMediaPlayer` interface, split it into smaller interfaces like `IAudioPlayer`, `IVideoPlayer`, and `IMediaLoader`.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Example: Instead of directly depending on concrete payment processors, use an `IPaymentProcessor` interface.

## Introduction
In this guide, we'll explore each SOLID principle, understand its importance, and see practical examples in various programming languages.

## Why SOLID?
SOLID principles help us create maintainable, extensible, and robust software. By following these principles, we can reduce code smells, improve code quality, and make our systems more adaptable to changes.

## What You'll Find Here
- Explanation of each SOLID principle
- Code snippets demonstrating how to apply SOLID principles
- Real-world scenarios where SOLID principles come into play

## Getting Started
To get started, choose a principle from the list above and dive into the details. Each principle will have "Before" and "After" code snippets to illustrate the transformation.
